<procdesc>Data were collected by trained field crews with the BLM and partner organizations. They followed the BLM core aquatic core and contingent indicators in TR 1735-2 (AIM National Aquatic Monitoring Framework: Field Protocol for Wadeable Lotic System). Pre-2021 data were captured electronically using the Stream And River Assessment Hub (SARAH), and 2021 and later data were collected using Survey123. They were managed by the data collectors, with oversight from BLM field offices, state offices, and the National Operations Center. This dataset has undergone rigorous QA/QC to ensure data quality.</procdesc>
